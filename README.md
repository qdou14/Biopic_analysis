### Qing Dou

Biopics, which showcase real-life stories, are known for their portrayal of important historical and cultural narratives. Despite their popularity, there's concern about how accurately they represent different races and genders, and the criteria for choosing the stories they tell. Our goal is to assess the fairness of these representations and the factors influencing story selection.

We'll analyze a detailed dataset covering many biopics over several years, focusing on the subjects' gender, race, and box office earnings. This data will help us explore key research questions regarding representation and story selection in biopics.

* Representation Analysis: How are characters of different races and genders represented in the top 100 highest-grossing films?
* Correlation Study: Is there a correlation between the diversity of race and gender in films and their box office performance?
* Trend Analysis: Has there been an improvement in the diversity of race and gender representation in films in recent years?

Additionally, we will incorporate the Bechdel test data to enrich our analysis. This approach will enable us to provide a comprehensive view of diversity in biographical films.
